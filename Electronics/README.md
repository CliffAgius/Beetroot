You will also need some 24AWG wire to complete the circuit and some skill at soldering, but fear not if you havn't used a soldering iron in a while I recommend this [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J5Sb21qbpEQ&t=12s) be warned though that Dave is sometimes a little colourful in his use of the english language...
